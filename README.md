# 101APLGAMES

Conversions to APL of the games in the book, "101 BASIC Games", as found here: https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decBooks10Mar75_26006648/page/n13/mode/2up

To function in the same way as those games, "tradfns" must be used.  Since they were originally written with the GoTo style, I will use that as well.

However, since APL allows go-to-label, I will label the lines to go to according to a sensible name for what the section does.

Other than the above, I will attempt to use modern techniques wherever appropriate.

Finally, I am not looking to reproduce the exact behaviors of the games. If I see potential improvements while remaining faithful to the spirit of the original,
I will adjust accordingly.
